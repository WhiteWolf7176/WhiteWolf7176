## Hello, I’m Sharath B (or WhiteWolf7176 in GitHub, but you can call me Sharath)

I’m a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for building impactful, real-world projects through **Full Stack Web Development** and **AI/ML**.

I'm a **self-taught developer**, learning from YouTube and hands-on projects. I'm most experienced with the **MERN stack**, **JavaScript**, and currently diving deep into **Python** and **Machine Learning**.

My goal is to **launch startup-grade platforms** — like **Rent It** — that solve real-world problems. I strongly believe in **project-based learning** and building to learn.

### Tech I’m comfortable with:
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C, Java
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express
- **Databases:** MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Netlify

### 2025 Goals:
- Launch MVP of my own web-based startup platform
- Build & deploy an Android application
- Host and scale **Rent It** online
- Compete in and (hopefully!) win **Smart India Hackathon**
- Land a **remote job or internship** in web dev or ML
- Continue learning **AI/ML** and apply it to real-world problems

### I'm open to:
- Open Source Contributions
- Hackathons & Hackathon Teams
- Freelance Projects
- Startup Collaborations
- Research Projects
- Remote Internships

> Fun fact: I see projects not just as code, but as potential products that can create value.  
> Whether it's building, scaling, or launching — I’m always up for the challenge.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
