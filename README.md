## 👋 Hello, I’m Sharath B (or WhiteWolf7176 in GitHub, but you can call me Sharath)

🎓 I’m a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for building impactful, real-world projects through **Full Stack Web Development** and **AI/ML**.

💻 I'm a **self-taught developer**, learning from YouTube and hands-on projects. I'm most experienced with the **MERN stack**, **JavaScript**, and currently diving deep into **Python** and **Machine Learning**.

🚀 My goal is to **launch startup-grade platforms** — like **Rent It** — that solve real-world problems. I strongly believe in **project-based learning** and building to learn.

### 🛠️ Tech I’m comfortable with:
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C, Java
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express
- **Databases:** MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Netlify

### 🎯 2025 Goals:
- 🚀 Launch MVP of my own web-based startup platform
- 📱 Build & deploy an Android application
- 🌍 Host and scale **Rent It** online
- 🏆 Compete in and (hopefully!) win **Smart India Hackathon**
- 💼 Land a **remote job or internship** in web dev or ML
- 🧠 Continue learning **AI/ML** and apply it to real-world problems

### 🤝 I'm open to:
- Open Source Contributions
- Hackathons & Hackathon Teams
- Freelance Projects
- Startup Collaborations
- Research Projects
- Remote Internships

> ⚡ Fun fact: I see projects not just as code, but as potential products that can create value.  
> Whether it's building, scaling, or launching — I’m always up for the challenge.

📬 Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
